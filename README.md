# yaxisLinear

Pre styled and positioned linear y axis for us with the FT's g-chartframe as part of the Visual Vocabulary. Will also work with other builds where the axis is called into a 'g' element appended to a pre-defined svg.

### Prerequisites
The [d3 library](https://d3js.org/) is already installed in the build

## Installing
### Manually install

Add the following line to the header of you index file.

### NPM install
Not yet deployed untill fully tested

## Configuring and calling

```
const myAxis = gAxis.yaxisLinear;
more code in here;
```
### Positioning
The above script appends a linear y axix to the current frame, returning the value yLabelOffset. The 
ticks are positioned on the right by default.
